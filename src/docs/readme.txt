-Q&A-
-----

Q:
My program does not create any shortcuts, and the log isn't showing that any 
had been created.

A:
If the application has been installed to the default Programs directory for
your system then the program may need to run as admin. One way to accomplish 
this is to set it in the desktop shortcut under: Advanced->Run As Admin.
